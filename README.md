intelligent belt

This project describes the development of a prototype in order to help visually impaired people to have a safe and independent travel.  This prototype will detect any static or moving object and guide the person in his mobility. The proposed system has a microcontroller, three ultrasonic sensors, and two vibrators mounted on a belt. This prototype is able to give information to visually impaired person about walking routes and distance of obstacle within eight meters along the path ahead of a user. This system is responsible for sensing the surrounding environment via ultrasonic sensor, detects closest obstacle around the user in almost 360 degrees with speech output through head phones and vibration feedback in order to guide the user in a proper way.
